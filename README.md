# WeirdPong
 
Weird Pong is a simple and slightly different pong game. Whenever the 
player's racket hits the ball, the speed of the ball increases. 
Additionally, whenever the player moves the racket, the camera moves as 
well, which makes the game more chaotic and crazy. The game can be 
played with 2 players on the same keyboard.
